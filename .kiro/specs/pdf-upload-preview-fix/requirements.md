# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses two critical issues in the EduSecure exam paper management system:
1. PDF upload process getting stuck at "Finalizing secure upload..." and "Processing..." stages
2. Preview images not displaying actual converted images (showing placeholders instead of real images)

The system currently converts PDFs to images and stores them in the papers directory, but the upload process doesn't complete properly, and the preview functionality doesn't display the actual images.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a faculty member, I want the PDF upload process to complete successfully without getting stuck, so that I can upload exam papers reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a faculty member uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL complete the entire upload process including metadata creation
2. WHEN the upload process encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
3. WHEN the upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message with upload details
4. WHEN the upload process finishes THEN the system SHALL create all required metadata files (metadata.json, integrity.sha256, chaos_key.enc)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with appropriate permissions, I want to see the actual converted images in the preview section, so that I can verify the uploaded content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the preview section THEN the system SHALL display the actual scrambled image from the papers directory
2. WHEN a user has permission to view original images THEN the system SHALL display the actual original image from the temp directory
3. WHEN images are not available THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages instead of generic placeholders
4. WHEN the preview API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return the correct image files with proper HTTP headers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for upload and preview operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upload or preview operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN API endpoints encounter errors THEN they SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle exceptions gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient logging information to identify root causes
