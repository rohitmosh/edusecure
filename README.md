# EduSecure: Secure Exam Paper Management System

A comprehensive secure exam paper management system that uses chaotic pixel scrambling, homomorphic encryption, and tamper-proof logging to protect exam papers until their scheduled release time.

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Chaotic Pixel Scrambling**: Uses logistic maps and Arnold Cat maps to make exam papers unreadable
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Paillier encryption for privacy-preserving metadata operations
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Ensures integrity verification of scrambled papers
- **Time-Lock Access Control**: Papers can only be decrypted at scheduled exam times
- **Tamper-Proof Logs**: Hash-chained audit logs for complete accountability
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate interfaces for Admin, Faculty, and Exam Centers

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Python Flask)
- **Chaotic Scrambling**: Custom implementation using NumPy
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Using the `phe` library (Paillier)
- **File-Based Storage**: No database required - uses JSON files and filesystem
- **PDF Processing**: Converts PDFs to images for scrambling

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Modern UI**: Built with shadcn/ui components
- **Role-Based Views**: Different interfaces for each user type
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatic polling for status changes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## 🚀 Quick Start

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

#### Frontend Setup:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Security Features Demo

Run the comprehensive security demonstration:
```bash
python demo_security_features.py
```

This showcases all cryptographic features with visual examples.

## 👥 User Roles & Demo Credentials

### Administrator
- **Username**: `admin1`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Capabilities**: 
  - View all uploaded papers
  - Release chaos keys at scheduled times
  - Verify paper integrity
  - Monitor security logs

### Faculty
- **Username**: `faculty1`
- **Password**: `faculty123`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Upload exam papers (PDF/DOCX)
  - View scrambling process
  - Cannot decrypt or access papers after upload

### Exam Center
- **Username**: `center1`
- **Password**: `center123`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Download scrambled papers
  - Decrypt papers when keys are released
  - View only - cannot upload or manage

## 📋 Usage Workflow

### 1. Faculty Upload Process
1. Login as faculty user
2. Select exam paper (PDF or DOCX)
3. Enter exam title and optional description
4. Click "Secure Upload"
5. System automatically:
   - Converts PDF to images
   - Applies chaotic pixel scrambling
   - Computes SHA-256 hashes
   - Encrypts metadata with Paillier
   - Stores encrypted chaos key

### 2. Admin Management
1. Login as admin user
2. View all uploaded papers in dashboard
3. Verify paper integrity using SHA-256 hashes
4. Release chaos keys at scheduled exam times
5. Monitor all system activity through security logs

### 3. Exam Center Access
1. Login as exam center user
2. Download scrambled papers (unreadable)
3. Wait for admin to release chaos key
4. Decrypt papers when key becomes available
5. Access original readable exam papers

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Cryptographic Components

#### Chaotic Pixel Scrambling
```python
# Logistic Map for pixel permutation
x_new = r * x * (1 - x)

# Arnold Cat Map for coordinate transformation
x_new = (x + a * y) % N
y_new = (b * x + (a * b + 1) * y) % N
```

#### Homomorphic Encryption
- Uses Paillier encryption for metadata
- Allows encrypted counter increments
- Preserves privacy of access patterns

#### Hash Chain Logging
```python
hash_new = SHA256(prev_hash + log_data)
```

## 🧪 Demo Scenarios

### 1. Unauthorized Early Access
- Exam center downloads scrambled file
- Attempts to view before scheduled time
- Paper remains unreadable without chaos key
- Access attempt logged in security audit

### 2. Integrity Verification
- Admin runs integrity check
- System recomputes SHA-256 hashes
- Compares with stored values
- Detects any tampering attempts

### 3. Time-Lock Release
- Papers uploaded with future schedule time
- Decryption denied before scheduled time
- Admin releases key at exact scheduled time
- Papers become readable for exam centers

### 4. Tamper Detection
- Modify any log entry manually
- System detects broken hash chain
- Alerts admin of tampering attempt
- Maintains audit trail integrity

## 🔍 Security Analysis

### Confidentiality
- Chaotic scrambling makes papers unreadable
